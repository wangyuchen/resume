	{\textbf{Research Assistant, East China Normal University, Shanghai}}
	{\textbf{July 2012 – December 2013}}
\begin{itemize}[topsep=2pt, itemsep=-2pt, nolistsep]
	\item To apply my statistics knowledge and programming skills into practice, I persuaded professor Xiaolong Pu to let me participate in his project as a student research assistant about statistical process control in tobacco processing.
	\begin{itemize}[topsep=2pt, itemsep=-2pt]
		\item The only undergraduate student in a research team of 7 consists of graduate students and faculties.
		\item Designed the control plan for tobacco dehumidification process under guidance, which is the most critical and complicated control unit among all tobacco processing processes.
		\item Two papers were completed (unpublished): one is on semi-parametric regression model for clustered data and the other is on design and implementation of a quality control software.
	\end{itemize}
	\item With the project moved into a new phase, the team expanded to 21 members. After graduation, I was hired as a full-time research assistant and became a team leader.
	\begin{itemize}[topsep=2pt, itemsep=-2pt]
		\item Instructed new members to learn about previously used models and programs. Tutored 7 members once a week to re-write previous programs in a unified manner.
		\item Developed an R package based on those re-written programs, which contains raw data, data cleaning methods, statistical algorithms and visualization methods used in the project.
		\item A paper discussing ridge estimators in models with correlated covariates is in review.
